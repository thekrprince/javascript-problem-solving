# PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH

## Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

### Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer.

## What is an Algorithm?

- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
- Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm! It's the foundation for being successful problem solver and developer.

### How do you improve ?

- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving

- Understand the problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look back and refactor

1. Understand the problem

   - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
   - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
   - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
   - Can the Output be determined from the input? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you are set to solve the problem. That is okay; it’s still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
   - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

    E.g. Write a function which takes 2 numbers and returns their sum.

    - We have to implement addition.
    - Is input gonna be int? or floats ? 0r what about string for large numbers?
    - Should the output be int, float or string.
    - Label for input can be num1, num2 and result can be labeled as sum.

2. Concrete Examples

    Explore Examples

    - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    - Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    E.g: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

    While exploring examples, do follow the below points

    - Start with Simple Examples
    - Progress to More Complex Examples
    - Explore examples with empty inputs
    - Explore Examples with invalid inputs

3. Break it down

    Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
    This forces us to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

4. Solve or Simplify

    Solve the Problem
        and if you can't
    Solve a Simpler problem.

    If you're unable to solve a complete problem and you can think of 70% or 80% solution then do it.
    In an interview, it's better to write code and explain that much rather than getting stuck.
    And may be when you're trying to simplify a problem, you can reach to the actual output as well.

    Simplify

    - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a Simplified solution
    - Then incorporate that difficulty back in.

5. Look Back and Refactor

    - It's always good to refactor the code as like writing a optimized solution or methods, changing variable name, etc.
