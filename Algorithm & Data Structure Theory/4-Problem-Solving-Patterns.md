# PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS

## Some common problem solving patterns which can help you approach different problems are

1. Frequency Counter
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Backtracking
8. And many more

## Now let's understand the above patterns in detail-

1. **Frequency Counter:** Frequency counter is a pattern where we need to find out how often an element occurs within some data structure or array of elements. It uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for **nested loops or O(n^2)** operations with array/strings.
