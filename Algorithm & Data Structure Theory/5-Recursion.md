# RECURSION

## A process (a function in our case) that calls itself.

### Why do you need to know this?

- Coz it's everywhere.
  1. JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
  2. document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
  3. Object traversal
  4. Very common with more complex algorithms
  5. It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

### How recursive function work?

- Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!

**Base Case-** The condition when the recursion ends.

**Two essential parts of a recursive function!**

- Base Case
- Different Input
