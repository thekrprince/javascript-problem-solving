# Sliding Window

    - Used for continuous arrays and strings.
    - Asked for finding maximum or minimum sizes or lengths or substrings.
    - The windows can't be far from each other.
    - Window size can be fixed or variable.

## Fixed size window approach

    - Initialize ```i``` and ```j``` with ```0```.
    - Run a while loop until j is smaller than array/string length.
    - Then do an operation based on the question asked.
    - Write an if condition where ```j-i+1``` is smaller than window size, and increase ```j```.
    - Once ```j-i+1``` becomes equal to the window size, do the operation to find the solution.

## Variable size window approach

    - Initialize ```i``` and ```j``` with ```0```.
    - Run a while loop until j is smaller than array/string length.
    - Then do an operation based on the question asked.
    - Write an if condition where the operation done is smaller than window size, and increase ```j```.
    - Once the  becomes equal to the window size, do the operation to find the solution.
