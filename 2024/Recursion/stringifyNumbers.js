/*
Write a function called stringifyNumbers which takes in an object and finds all of the values which are numbers and converts them to strings. 
Recursion would be a great way to solve this!

The exercise intends for you to create a new object with the numbers converted to strings, and not modify the original. Keep the original object unchanged.
