# Sliding Window

    - Used for continuous arrays and strings.
    - Asked for finding maximum or minimum sizes or lengths or substrings.
    - The windows can't be far from each other.
    - Window size can be fixed or variable.

## Fixed size window approach

    - Initialize `i` and ```j``` with ```0```.
    - Run a while loop until j is smaller than array/string length.
    - First do a calculation based on the question asked.
    - Write an if condition where window size is smaller than k, and increase ```j```.
    - Once window size is equal to k, do the calculations to find the answer.
    - Calculations to remove i.
    - Maintain window size and slide i and j by 1.

    ```javascript
    while(j < size>) {
        calculations;

        if(window size < k) {
            j++;
        } else if(window size === k) {
            ans;               // calculation
            calculations to remove i;
            window size maintain and slide;
        }

        return ans;
    }
    ```

## Variable size window approach

    - Initialize ```i``` and ```j``` with ```0```.
    - Run a while loop until j is smaller than array/string length.
    - Then do an operation based on the question asked.
    - Write an if condition where the operation done is smaller than window size, and increase ```j```.
    - Once the condition becomes equal to the window size, do the operation to find the solution.
    - If condition becomes greater than the k, then do calculations to remove i;

    General format

    ```javascript
    while(j < size) {
        calculations;

        if(calculations < k) {
            j++;
        } else if(calculations === k) {
            ans;        // calculation
            j++;
        } else if(calculations > k) {
            while(calculations > k) {
                remove calculation for i;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
    ```
